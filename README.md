# Cryptography Project

## Background
This is just a programming assignment project of a cryptography course.
The assignment requires implementing a RSA-encrypted-key crypto system.
I'm creating this repository solely for practicing purposes.
There is **no security guarantee** in the project.
If you happen to be my classmate and wanted to take this as a reference for 
your own assignment you're more than welcome. **JUST DON'T COPY.**

## Development Settings
This project is developed in [Python 3](https://docs.python.org/3/) and 
_mainly_ (:smirk:) follows [Google Python Style Guild](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/pyguide.md).
Despite Python 2.7 will reach the end of its life on January 1st, 2020, if 
you're only comfortable with [Python 2](https://docs.python.org/2/), there is
 a tool [3to2](https://pypi.org/project/3to2/) that might be helpful for you.
